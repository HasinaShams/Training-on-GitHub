### Training-on-GitHub
The GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. It also encourage teams to work together to build and edit their site content. Thru creating an account we can have access to GitHub.

* Repository Creation:
   * In order to write and safe file on GitHub we first should make a repository, which it takes multiple steps such as: After creation of account in GitHub and singing in to it,Select New tub on the left uper side of screen > Create repository name > Tick add a README file > click on create repository > write title by adding .md at the end of it > Write the notes after it at the last for submition click on Commit Changes. By going thru this steps our repository are made.
* Sharing of repository file link: 
   * If we want to share the link of our created repository with our colleagues so we open the saved repository > copy the link > open the teams chat group > press Ctrl+K > paste the link > write a title name for the link> insert also we can give some details about the link.         
* Editing of font:
     * For the resize of title or any text we use # then space then the text also by adding more #s the size get more smaller.   
* Adding Bullet Points:
     * For having bullet points in the begining of our writting text first we inter then press three times space then add */- again a space then write the text.
     * For having sub bullet points in the begining of our text the same process will work for it.
